# OCR Architecture Cleanup Summary

## Problem
The OCR architecture document contains extensive implementation code that violates KISS, YAGNI, and basic architecture documentation principles:

- 76+ lines of implementation code (`public class`, `private readonly`, `public async Task`)
- Full class implementations (CASStorage, DocumentProcessingService, etc.)
- Detailed method bodies with implementation logic
- Private field declarations

## Violations of Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Architecture document is bloated with HOW instead of WHAT
- 3400+ lines when it should be ~500-1000 lines

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Implementation details that change frequently
- Code that belongs in source files, not docs

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Implementation duplicated between docs and actual code
- Maintenance nightmare when code changes

### TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)
- "What if this implementation code didn't need to exist in docs?"
- Answer: It doesn't! Architecture should describe design, not implementation

## Recommendation
Remove ALL implementation code and replace with:
1. Interface definitions only (if necessary)
2. Architectural descriptions
3. Mermaid diagrams
4. High-level data flow descriptions

The document should describe the ARCHITECTURE, not the IMPLEMENTATION.
