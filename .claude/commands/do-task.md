# Do Task - Multi-Agent Collaboration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Sequential Task Execution
**Agents MUST work on tasks ONE AT A TIME, not all at once:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Select Task 1 ‚Üí Complete it ‚Üí Select Task 2 ‚Üí Complete it
- ‚ùå WRONG: Create todo list with all 8 tasks ‚Üí Try to do them all
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Working on Task 4.3: Integrate LoginAdapterComponent"
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Creating todo list with tasks 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3"

## Overview
This command orchestrates multiple specialized agents to work together on a complex task, similar to pair programming but adapted for any type of work. Agents take turns contributing their expertise, reviewing each other's work, and iterating until the task is complete.

## Usage
```
/do-task <agent1,agent2,...> <task_description>
/do-task <shortcut> <task_description>
/do-task <task_description>  # Auto-selects best agents for the task
```

## Auto-Selection
When no agents are specified, the command **MUST** automatically match the best pair of agents based on the task description:
- **Testing/QA tasks** ‚Üí `qa-automation-engineer and principal-engineer`
- **Security/Crypto tasks** ‚Üí `system-architect-crypto and principal-engineer`
- **Blazor/WebAssembly tasks** ‚Üí `system-architect-blazor and principal-engineer`
- **Application architecture** ‚Üí `system-architect-app and principal-engineer`
- **Implementation tasks** ‚Üí `principal-engineer 1 and principal-engineer 2`
- **Architecture tasks** ‚Üí `system-architect-app and system-architect-crypto`
- **Git/Release tasks** ‚Üí `principal-engineer and git-flow-automation`
- **Complex features** ‚Üí `system-architect-app and principal-engineer`

## Shortcuts
- `engineers` ‚Üí `principal-engineer 1 and principal-engineer 2`
- `architects` ‚Üí `system-architect-crypto 1 and system-architect-crypto 2`

## Examples

### With Explicit Agents
```
/do-task principal-engineer and system-architect-crypto to Design and implement a secure messaging system
/do-task principal-engineer and git-flow-automation to Refactor the authentication module and prepare a release
/do-task system-architect-crypto and principal-engineer to Review and optimize the cryptographic architecture
```

### With Shortcuts
```
/do-task engineers Build a REST API with comprehensive tests
/do-task architects Design microservices architecture with security patterns
```

### With Auto-Selection (No Agents Specified)
```
/do-task Write comprehensive test suite with coverage  # Auto-selects: qa-automation-engineer agent and principal-engineer agent
/do-task Design Blazor component architecture  # Auto-selects: system-architect-blazor agent and principal-engineer agent
/do-task Create microservices architecture  # Auto-selects: system-architect-app agent and system-architect-crypto agent
/do-task Debug failing tests and analyze logs  # Auto-selects: qa-automation-engineer agent and principal-engineer agent
/do-task Design secure authentication system  # Auto-selects: system-architect-crypto agent and principal-engineer agent
/do-task Implement user management features  # Auto-selects: principal-engineer agent 1 and principal-engineer agent 2
/do-task Prepare release and update changelog  # Auto-selects: principal-engineer agent and git-flow-automation agent
```

## Process

1. **Task Analysis Phase**
   - First agent analyzes the task and creates an initial plan
   - Identifies key components and dependencies
   - Establishes success criteria

2. **Sequential Task Execution**
   - **CRITICAL: Agents work on ONE task at a time, NOT all tasks at once**
   - Agents select a single task from the task file or todo list
   - Complete that task with mutual agreement before moving to the next
   - Continue sequentially until all tasks are complete

3. **Completion Criteria**
   - **Every todo item has mutual agreement from both agents**
   - All agents agree the overall task is done
   - Success criteria are met
   - No critical issues remain
   - No todo can be marked complete without explicit agreement from both agents

## Agent Coordination - Explicit Task Division

The agents work in clearly defined rounds with specific responsibilities:

### Round-by-Round Coordination

**Round 1: Task Analysis & Planning**
- **Agent 1** analyzes the task, breaks it down into components, creates initial todo list
- **Agent 2** reviews Agent 1's analysis, adds missing components, refines todo list
- **Both agents** establish clear success criteria and task boundaries

**Round 2+: Alternating Implementation & Review**
- **Agent 1** implements specific components from todo list, marks items in_progress, proposes completion
- **Agent 2** reviews Agent 1's work, agrees/disagrees on completion, implements different components
- **Agent 1** incorporates Agent 2's feedback, fixes issues if needed, continues with next todo items
- **Agent 2** validates changes, confirms completion when satisfied, adds new todos if gaps discovered
- **Items only marked complete when BOTH agents explicitly agree**
- **Continue alternating** until all todos have mutual agreement

**Final Round: Validation & Sign-off**
- **Agent 1** performs final review of all completed work
- **Agent 2** validates against success criteria
- **Both agents** must explicitly agree: "TASK COMPLETE"

### Specific Agent Responsibilities

**Agent 1 (Primary Implementer)**:
- Creates initial plan and todo list
- Implements core functionality
- **Validates work against task description**
- **Ensures compliance with architecture docs**
- Responds to Agent 2's feedback
- Ensures code quality and tests
- Performs final integration

**Agent 2 (Reviewer/Secondary Implementer)**:
- Reviews and validates Agent 1's work
- **Cross-checks against original requirements**
- **Verifies architecture compliance (when provided)**
- Identifies gaps and edge cases
- Implements complementary features
- Ensures requirements are met
- Validates final deliverable against relevant documentation

## Mutual Agreement Rules

### Todo Completion Requirements
1. **No Unilateral Completion**: An agent CANNOT mark a todo as complete on their own
2. **Explicit Agreement Required**: Both agents must explicitly state agreement
3. **Disagreement = More Work**: If either agent disagrees, work continues on that item
4. **Clear Agreement Language**: Use "I AGREE todo #X is complete" for clarity

### Agreement Process
- **Proposing Completion**: "I believe todo #X is complete because [reasons]"
- **Agreeing**: "I AGREE todo #X is complete" 
- **Disagreeing**: "Todo #X is NOT complete, needs [specific fixes]"
- **After Fixes**: "Fixed [issues]. Requesting agreement on todo #X"

### Validation Requirements
**Agents MUST always validate work against:**
1. **Original Task Description**: Does the work fulfill what was requested?
2. **Architecture Documentation (when provided)**: Does it follow the documented patterns and requirements?
3. **Success Criteria**: Does it meet all defined success metrics?
4. **Technical Standards**: Does it follow best practices and coding standards?
5. **Any other relevant documentation mentioned in the task**

### Task Cannot End Until:
- Every single todo has mutual agreement
- Both agents state "TASK COMPLETE"
- No todos remain in "in_progress" state
- All work validated against task description and relevant documentation

## Automatic Task File Tracking

When working on tasks, agents **MUST** automatically update task files if they exist:

### Task File Detection
Agents automatically search for and update task files in:
- `/docs/scrum/tasks/*.md` - Scrum task files
- `/docs/tasks/*.md` - General task files  
- `/tasks/*.md` - Root task files
- Any `.md` file referenced in the task description

### Task Status Markers
Agents update task checkboxes with status indicators:
- `- [ ]` = Not started
- `- [üîÑ]` = In progress (started by an agent)
- `- [‚úÖ]` = Complete (both agents agreed)
- `- [‚ùå]` = Blocked or failed

### Update Protocol
1. **When starting a task**: Change `- [ ]` to `- [üîÑ]`
2. **When proposing completion**: Keep as `- [üîÑ]` until agreement
3. **When both agree**: Change `- [üîÑ]` to `- [‚úÖ]`
4. **Add timestamps**: Include date/time of status changes
5. **Add agent notes**: Document who worked on what

### Example Task File Updates
```markdown
<!-- Original -->
### Task 2.1: Implement LoginService [P0]
- [ ] Create ILoginService interface
- [ ] Implement service logic
- [ ] Add unit tests

<!-- After Agent 1 starts -->
### Task 2.1: Implement LoginService [P0] 
**Status**: In Progress (Started: 2024-03-14 10:30 by Engineer 1)
- [üîÑ] Create ILoginService interface
- [üîÑ] Implement service logic  
- [ ] Add unit tests

<!-- After both agents agree complete -->
### Task 2.1: Implement LoginService [P0]
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (2024-03-14 12:15)
**Completed by**: Engineer 1 & Engineer 2 (mutual agreement)
- [‚úÖ] Create ILoginService interface
- [‚úÖ] Implement service logic
- [‚úÖ] Add unit tests
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sequential execution** - Work on ONE task at a time, complete it, then move to next
2. **Choose complementary agents** - Select agents whose skills complement each other
3. **Clear task definition** - Provide specific, measurable goals
4. **Let agents iterate** - Allow multiple rounds for complex tasks
5. **Trust the process** - Agents will coordinate naturally
6. **Enforce mutual agreement** - No todo is done until both agents agree
7. **Track in task files** - Automatically update task files when they exist
8. **Avoid task overload** - NEVER load all remaining tasks at once
9. **Quality over speed** - Complete each task properly before moving on
10. **Smart task management** - When using TodoWrite:
    - Add ONLY the current task being worked on
    - Complete it with mutual agreement
    - Then add the next single task
    - NEVER create a list with all remaining tasks at once

## Auto-Agent Selection Algorithm

When no agents are provided, the command **MUST** analyze the task description and select the optimal agent pair:

1. **Scan for Keywords**:
   - Test/QA/coverage/integration/unit/e2e/smoke ‚Üí Include `qa-automation-engineer`
   - Security/crypto/auth/encrypt/sign ‚Üí Include `system-architect-crypto`
   - Blazor/WebAssembly/WASM/SignalR ‚Üí Include `system-architect-blazor`
   - Application/app/microservices/monolith ‚Üí Include `system-architect-app`
   - Build/implement/code/feature ‚Üí Include `principal-engineer`
   - Architecture/design/system/scale ‚Üí Include appropriate architect
   - Git/release/branch/version/deploy ‚Üí Include `git-flow-automation`
   - Logs/debugging/troubleshoot/analyze ‚Üí Include `qa-automation-engineer`

2. **Apply Selection Rules**:
   - If task mentions testing/QA ‚Üí `qa-automation-engineer and principal-engineer`
   - If task mentions Blazor/WASM ‚Üí `system-architect-blazor and principal-engineer`
   - If task mentions app architecture ‚Üí `system-architect-app and principal-engineer`
   - If task mentions security AND implementation ‚Üí `system-architect-crypto and principal-engineer`
   - If task is pure implementation ‚Üí `engineers` (two principal engineers)
   - If task is pure architecture ‚Üí `system-architect-app and system-architect-crypto`
   - If task involves git workflow ‚Üí `principal-engineer and git-flow-automation`
   - Default for complex tasks ‚Üí `system-architect-app and principal-engineer`

3. **Examples of Auto-Selection**:
   - "Write unit and integration tests" ‚Üí Detects "tests" ‚Üí `qa-automation-engineer and principal-engineer`
   - "Design Blazor component architecture" ‚Üí Detects "Blazor" ‚Üí `system-architect-blazor and principal-engineer`
   - "Create microservices architecture" ‚Üí Detects "microservices" ‚Üí `system-architect-app and system-architect-crypto`
   - "Debug failing tests and analyze logs" ‚Üí Detects "tests" + "logs" ‚Üí `qa-automation-engineer and principal-engineer`
   - "Build REST API endpoints" ‚Üí Detects "build" + "API" ‚Üí `engineers`
   - "Fix bugs and create release" ‚Üí Detects "release" ‚Üí `principal-engineer and git-flow-automation`

## How It Works - Explicit Agent Actions

The command orchestrates a multi-agent collaboration through these phases:

### Phase 1: Task Analysis (Rounds 1-2)

**Round 1 - Agent 1 says:**
"I'll analyze this task and break it down. First, let me check for existing task files... Found `/docs/scrum/tasks/[relevant-file].md`. Reading task breakdown from file. The main components are: [lists components from file]. Creating todo list from the task file with [X] items. Updating task file to mark items as in progress. My plan is to [describes approach]."

**Round 2 - Agent 2 says:**
"Reviewing Agent 1's analysis and the task file. I agree with components A, B, C from the file. However, we also need to consider [additional aspects]. Adding todos for [missing items]. Updating task file with additional discovered tasks. Let me refine the success criteria to include [specific metrics]."

### Phase 2: Collaborative Work Loop (Rounds 3+)

**CRITICAL SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION RULE:**
- **Work on ONE task at a time from the task file**
- **Do NOT create a todo list with ALL remaining tasks**
- **Complete current task with mutual agreement BEFORE selecting next task**
- **Example**: If there are 8 tasks remaining, work on Task 1, complete it, THEN select Task 2

**Round N - Agent 1 says:**
"Looking at the task file, I'll work on the NEXT SINGLE task: Task 3.1 [specific task description]. Updating task file - marking ONLY Task 3.1 as [üîÑ] in progress. I'm implementing [specific solution]. Code/content created: [shows work]. I believe Task 3.1 is ready for review. NOT starting another task until we agree on this one."

**Round N+1 - Agent 2 says:**
"Reviewing Agent 1's implementation of Task 3.1. Checking against task description and architecture docs... Found issues: [lists problems]. The implementation doesn't follow the architecture pattern specified in section X. Task 3.1 is NOT complete yet - needs [improvement]. Keeping status as [üîÑ] in task file. Let me help fix Task 3.1 before we move to any other task."

**Round N+2 - Agent 1 says:**
"Fixed the issues in Task 3.1: [shows fixes]. Now follows architecture pattern from section X. Validated against original task requirements. Requesting your approval to mark Task 3.1 complete in the file. Waiting for your agreement before selecting next task."

**Round N+3 - Agent 2 says:**
"Reviewing Task 3.1 fixes - validating against architecture doc... Confirmed it now matches the documented pattern. Cross-checked with task description - all requirements met. I AGREE Task 3.1 is complete. Updating task file: Task 3.1 now [‚úÖ]. Now selecting the NEXT SINGLE task from the file: Task 3.2. I'll work on this one task."

**Round N+4 - Agent 1 says:**
"Good, Task 3.1 is complete. Reviewing your work on Task 3.2... This violates the constraint mentioned in the task description about [specific concern]. Task 3.2 NOT complete. Let me help fix this issue in Task 3.2."

**Round N+5 - Agent 2 says:**
"Task 3.2 fix confirmed. I AGREE Task 3.2 is complete. Updating task file: Task 3.2 now [‚úÖ]. Current status: 2 tasks complete. Now selecting ONLY the next task: Task 3.3. Working on this single task..."

**Important Sequential Task Management**:
- **NEVER create a todo list with ALL remaining tasks at once**
- **Select and work on ONE task at a time**
- **Complete current task with mutual agreement BEFORE selecting next**
- If using TodoWrite tool, add ONLY the current working task, not all tasks
- **Items can ONLY be marked complete when BOTH agents explicitly agree**
- **If one agent disagrees, the item remains in_progress and work continues**
- **Sequential execution prevents overwhelming context and ensures quality**

**Mutual Agreement Protocol**:
- Agent 1: "I believe todo #X is complete"
- Agent 2: "I AGREE todo #X is complete" ‚Üí Mark as complete
- OR
- Agent 2: "Todo #X needs more work: [specific issues]" ‚Üí Remains in_progress

### Phase 3: Consensus & Completion

**Final Round - Agent 1 says:**
"All todos are now complete. Let me validate against original task description: [checks each requirement]. Verifying architecture compliance: [confirms patterns followed]. Running final tests: [test results]. Everything passes. I believe we've met all success criteria. TASK COMPLETE."

**Final Round - Agent 2 says:**
"Performing final validation: 
- ‚úì Original task description: All requirements fulfilled
- ‚úì Relevant documentation: Follows provided architecture/design docs
- ‚úì Success criteria: All metrics achieved
- ‚úì Technical standards: Code quality and tests meet standards
- ‚úì All todos have mutual agreement
I agree the task is complete. TASK COMPLETE."

### Clear Handoff Protocol

Each agent explicitly states:
1. **What they just did**: "I implemented X using approach Y"
2. **What they're handing off**: "Agent 2, please review my implementation of X"
3. **What they expect next**: "After your review, we should tackle todo #5"
4. **Current todo status**: "Todos complete: 3/7, In progress: #4"

Example handoff:
- **Agent 1**: "I've completed the authentication service (todo #2). Tests are passing. Agent 2, please review the security aspects while I start on the UI components (todo #3)."
- **Agent 2**: "Reviewing your auth service now. Security looks good but needs rate limiting. I'll add that (new todo #8) while you continue with UI."

### WRONG vs RIGHT Approach

#### ‚ùå WRONG Approach (Trying to do all tasks at once):
```
Agent 1: "I see 8 remaining tasks. Creating todo list:
1. Task 4.3: Integrate LoginAdapterComponent
2. Task 5.1: Create Integration Test Suite
3. Task 5.2: Security Validation Tests
4. Task 5.3: User Experience Testing
5. Task 5.4: Performance Testing
6. Task 6.1: Update Architecture Documentation
7. Task 6.2: Create User Guide
8. Task 6.3: Code Review and Refactoring
Let me start working on all of these..."
```
**This is WRONG because it tries to handle everything at once!**

#### ‚úÖ RIGHT Approach (Sequential, one at a time):
```
Agent 1: "Looking at the task file, the next incomplete task is Task 4.3: 
Integrate LoginAdapterComponent into Home Page. I'll work on ONLY this 
task now. Marking Task 4.3 as [üîÑ] in progress..."

Agent 2: "Reviewing your Task 4.3 implementation... I AGREE it's complete.
Marking Task 4.3 as [‚úÖ]. Now selecting the NEXT task: Task 5.1: Create 
Integration Test Suite. Working on this single task..."
```
**This is RIGHT because it focuses on one task at a time!**

### Detailed Coordination Examples

#### Example 1: Architecture Design Task
```
/do-task system-architect-crypto,principal-engineer Design secure login system
```

**Round 1:**
- **Architect (Agent 1)**: "I'll design the authentication flow with these components: KeyDerivation, SessionState, LoginAdapter. Creating todos: 1) Crypto specs, 2) API design, 3) Security docs"
- **Developer (Agent 2)**: "I see gaps. Adding todos: 4) Error handling, 5) UI components, 6) Integration tests. Starting on todo #5."

**Round 2:**
- **Architect (Agent 1)**: "Completed todo #1: PBKDF2 with 100k iterations, ECDSA P-256. I believe it's ready."
- **Developer (Agent 2)**: "Reviewing todo #1 - need to specify memory cleanup. NOT complete yet. My todo #5 (UI) is ready for your review."

**Round 3:**
- **Architect (Agent 1)**: "Todo #5 needs loading states. NOT complete. Fixed todo #1 with memory cleanup specs."
- **Developer (Agent 2)**: "Todo #1 now complete - I AGREE. Fixed todo #5 with loading states."

**Round 4:**
- **Architect (Agent 1)**: "I AGREE todo #5 is complete. Working on todo #2 (API design)..."
- **Developer (Agent 2)**: "Good. Starting todo #6 (tests) while you finish #2..."

#### Example 2: Two Engineers Collaboration
```
/do-task engineers Build REST API with authentication
```

**Round 1:**
- **Engineer 1 (Agent 1)**: "I'll design the API structure. Creating todos: 1) API routes, 2) Data models, 3) Auth middleware, 4) Tests, 5) Documentation"
- **Engineer 2 (Agent 2)**: "Good structure. I'll add: 6) Input validation, 7) Error handling, 8) Rate limiting. I'll start on data models while you do routes."

**Round 2:**
- **Engineer 1 (Agent 1)**: "Implemented routes in /api/routes. Using Express with TypeScript. Ready for review."
- **Engineer 2 (Agent 2)**: "Routes look good but need async error wrapper. NOT complete. My data models with Prisma are ready for your review."

**Round 3:**
- **Engineer 1 (Agent 1)**: "Added async wrapper to routes. I AGREE routes are complete. Your models need unique constraints on email."
- **Engineer 2 (Agent 2)**: "Fixed models. Both working on auth middleware now - I'll do JWT, you do session management."

#### Example 3: Two Architects Collaboration
```
/do-task architects Design distributed payment system
```

**Round 1:**
- **Architect 1 (Agent 1)**: "Analyzing requirements. I'll focus on: 1) System topology, 2) Data flow, 3) Security boundaries"
- **Architect 2 (Agent 2)**: "I'll complement with: 4) Consensus mechanisms, 5) Cryptographic protocols, 6) Failure recovery"

**Round 2:**
- **Architect 1 (Agent 1)**: "Proposed topology: 3-tier with service mesh. Event-driven with Kafka. Documenting in architecture.md"
- **Architect 2 (Agent 2)**: "Topology solid. Adding Byzantine fault tolerance. Proposing ECDSA for signatures, AES-256-GCM for encryption."

**Round 3:**
- **Architect 1 (Agent 1)**: "Integrated your crypto specs. Added API gateway pattern. Todo #1-3 ready for agreement."
- **Architect 2 (Agent 2)**: "Reviewing against security standards... I AGREE todos #1-3 complete. Finalizing consensus protocol..."

    I -->|Yes| J[Agent 1: Final Review]
    J --> K[Agent 2: Validation]
    K --> L[Both: TASK COMPLETE]
```

### Coordination Protocol
Each agent receives context including:
- Original task description
- All previous work from all agents
- Current round number
- List of participating agents
- Current todo list status (including dynamically added items)

Agents communicate through:
- Structured work products
- Clear status declarations
- Consensus confirmations
- Improvement suggestions
- Todo list updates:
  - Marking items as in_progress when starting work
  - Proposing items for completion, requiring mutual agreement
  - Only marking complete after both agents explicitly agree
  - **Adding new todo items when discovering additional work**
  - Tracking overall progress across all todos with consensus

## Limitations

1. **Max 100 rounds** - Prevents infinite loops
2. **Agents must reach consensus** - All agents must agree task is complete
3. **Sequential execution** - Agents work in turns, not parallel
4. **Context limits** - Very large tasks may exceed context

## Tips

1. **Start with 2-3 agents** - More agents increase coordination overhead
2. **Be specific** - Vague tasks lead to unfocused work
3. **Include success criteria** - Help agents know when they're done
4. **Mix specialties** - Architect + implementer works well
5. **Trust iteration** - Let agents refine through multiple rounds

## Error Handling

The command will:
- **Auto-select agents if none provided** based on task analysis
- Validate agent names exist (if explicitly provided)
- Ensure task description is provided
- Prevent infinite loops with round limit
- Require consensus for completion
- Provide clear status updates
- **Announce selected agents** when auto-selection occurs

## Output

The command returns:
- Task description and agents involved
- Number of rounds completed
- Final status (complete or max rounds)
- Summary of final outcome
- **Task file update summary** (if task file exists)
  - Total tasks in file
  - Tasks completed [‚úÖ]
  - Tasks in progress [üîÑ]
  - Tasks remaining [ ]
  - Link to updated task file
- Complete work history available on request

### Example Final Report
```
‚úÖ Task Complete after 12 rounds

Agents: principal-engineer 1 & principal-engineer 2
Task: Implement login functionality

Task File Status (/docs/scrum/tasks/login-implementation-tasks.md):
