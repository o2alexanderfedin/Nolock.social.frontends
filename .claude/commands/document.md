# Share Understanding

## Intent
When you need to help others understand your code, architecture, or decisions - whether it's future you, team members, or users - this command creates documentation that truly communicates.

## What This Does For You
- **Captures knowledge** - Preserves important understanding
- **Explains decisions** - Documents why, not just what
- **Enables others** - Helps people use and maintain your work
- **Reduces confusion** - Clarifies complex concepts
- **Saves time** - Answers questions before they're asked

## How to Express Your Intent

### Describe What Needs Understanding
Express what should be documented:
- "Explain how the authentication works"
- "Document the API endpoints"
- "Describe the architecture decisions"
- "Help new developers get started"

### Specify the Audience
Mention who needs to understand:
- "For new team members"
- "For API consumers"
- "For system administrators"
- "For future maintenance"

## Usage Examples
```
/document
/document Explain the payment processing flow
/document Create API documentation for external partners
/document Document architecture decisions for the team
/document Help new developers understand the codebase
```

## Types of Understanding to Share

### How Things Work
- System architecture and design
- Component interactions
- Data flows and transformations
- Business logic and rules

### How to Use Things
- API endpoints and contracts
- Configuration options
- Integration patterns
- Common workflows

### Why Decisions Were Made
- Architectural choices
- Technology selections
- Trade-off considerations
- Design rationale

### How to Contribute
- Development setup
- Coding standards
- Testing approaches
- Contribution process

## Documentation Approaches

The system creates the right type of documentation:

### Architecture Documentation
For system understanding:
- Component diagrams
- Sequence flows
- Decision records
- Pattern descriptions

### API Documentation
For integration needs:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Authentication details
- Error handling

### Developer Guides
For contribution:
- Setup instructions
- Development workflows
- Debugging tips
- Best practices

### User Documentation
For end users:
- Feature descriptions
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guides
- FAQs

## What to Expect

### Analysis Phase
Documentation experts will:
- Understand what needs documenting
- Identify the target audience
- Determine the best format
- Plan the documentation structure

### Creation Process
The documentation includes:
- Clear explanations
- Relevant examples
- Visual diagrams when helpful
- Practical guidance

### Delivered Documentation
You'll receive:
- Well-structured documents
- Clear, concise explanations
- Appropriate level of detail
- Maintainable format

## Common Scenarios

### "New team member joining"
Documentation will cover setup, architecture overview, key concepts, and how to contribute effectively.

### "Releasing an API"
Documentation will include endpoints, authentication, examples, and integration guidance.

### "Complex feature completed"
Documentation will explain how it works, why it was built that way, and how to maintain it.

### "Architectural change made"
Documentation will capture the decision, rationale, alternatives considered, and implications.

## Success Indicators

Good documentation achieves:
- Readers understand without asking questions
- Complex topics become approachable
- Decisions and rationale are preserved
- Maintenance becomes easier
- Onboarding time reduces

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Think about your reader** - Who needs this information?
2. **Focus on the why** - Explain reasoning, not just facts
3. **Provide examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Keep it current** - Update docs with code changes

## Documentation Formats

The system chooses appropriate formats:

### Markdown Files
- README files for quick understanding
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Developer guides
- API documentation

### Code Comments
- Inline explanations for complex logic
- Interface documentation
- Usage examples
- Warning notes

### Diagrams and Visuals
- System architecture diagrams
- Sequence flows
- State machines
- Data models

### Interactive Documentation
- API playgrounds
- Code examples
- Tutorial walkthroughs
- Video explanations

## The Value of Good Documentation

Quality documentation provides:
- **Efficiency** - Reduces time spent explaining
- **Consistency** - Everyone has the same understanding
- **Sustainability** - Knowledge survives team changes
- **Professionalism** - Shows care for users and maintainers

Remember: Focus on WHAT needs to be understood and WHO needs to understand it, and let the system create documentation that truly communicates.
