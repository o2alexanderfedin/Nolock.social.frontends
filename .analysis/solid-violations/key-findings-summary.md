# SOLID Violations Summary

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. Single Responsibility Violations (SRP)
- **19 files exceed 300 lines** (architectural smell)
- **Largest offender:** CameraService.cs (1,035 lines, 7+ responsibilities)
- **Pattern:** God objects controlling entire subsystems
- **Test files:** 600+ lines indicating test duplication

### 2. Open-Closed Principle Status (OCP)
- **Only 2 sealed classes** found (good - allows extension)
- **20 virtual/override/abstract** keywords (limited extensibility)
- **Concern:** Low ratio of extension points to class count
- **Pattern:** Most classes are concrete with no extension mechanism

### 3. Liskov Substitution (LSP)
- **0 NotImplementedException** found (good - no obvious violations)
- **No TODO/FIXME** in implementations (good - complete contracts)
- **Risk:** Large interfaces may force partial implementations

### 4. Interface Segregation (ISP)
- **20+ classes with 20+ public members**
- **Largest interface:** 43 members (PerformanceMetrics.cs)
- **Pattern:** Fat interfaces forcing clients to depend on unused methods
- **Top violators:** ISyncService (31), ICameraService (32)

### 5. Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- **~40 direct instantiation violations** remaining (reduced from 59)
- **Pattern:** Services creating concrete dependencies
- **✅ IMPROVED:** Guard class reduces direct instantiations
- **Limited abstraction usage:** Only 20 abstract members in entire Core

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: God Object Decomposition
1. **CameraService** → 5-7 focused services
2. **DocumentProcessingQueue** → Queue + Retry + Persistence
3. **DocumentProcessorRegistry** → Factory + Strategy pattern

### Priority 2: Interface Segregation
1. Split ISyncService (31 members) into role interfaces
2. Reduce ICameraService (32 members) to focused contracts
3. Apply Interface Segregation to all 20+ member interfaces

### Priority 3: Dependency Injection
1. Introduce factory pattern for 59 violation points
2. Replace concrete instantiations with abstractions
3. Implement proper DI container configuration

## Score: C- (45/100) ↑ Improved
- SRP: 19 files >300 lines (unchanged)
- ISP: 20+ fat interfaces (unchanged)
- DIP: ~40 direct `new` calls ✅ (reduced from 59)
- **✅ NEW:** Guard utility class for validation
- **✅ NEW:** ValidationMessages for string constants
