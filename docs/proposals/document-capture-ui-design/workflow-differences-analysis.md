**Status**: Architectural Impact Assessment  

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the differences between the current DocumentCapture workflow and the proposed preview-first approach, identifying specific architectural changes needed for implementation.

## 1. Current Workflow Analysis

### 1.1 Current Process Flow
```
Camera Capture → HandleCameraImageCaptured() → ImageProcessingService.ProcessAsync() → Immediate CAS Storage → Add to capturedImages List → Display in CapturedImagesPreview
```

### 1.2 Current Implementation Details

#### Key Method: `HandleCameraImageCaptured()` (Lines 368-400)
```csharp
private async Task HandleCameraImageCaptured(CapturedImage capturedImage)
{
    // 1. Add to local list immediately
    capturedImages.Add(capturedImage);
    
    // 2. IMMEDIATE processing and CAS storage
    var processingResult = await ImageProcessingService.ProcessAsync(capturedImage);
    
    // 3. Store quality result for UI feedback
    lastQualityResult = processingResult.QualityResult;
}
```

#### Current Data Flow Characteristics
- **Immediate Storage**: Photos stored in CAS upon capture
- **Synchronous Processing**: Processing happens in capture handler
- **No Selection Phase**: All captured photos automatically processed
- **Direct OCR Submission**: `ProcessDocument()` retrieves from CAS and submits to OCR

## 2. Proposed Workflow Analysis

### 2.1 Proposed Process Flow
```
Camera Capture → Preview Panel → User Selection → CAS Storage → OCR Processing
```

### 2.2 Proposed Implementation Requirements

#### New Preview-First Approach
```
Camera Capture → HandleCameraImageCaptured() → Add to Preview Panel → User Selects Photos → ProcessSelectedImages() → CAS Storage → OCR Submission
```

## 3. Key Differences Identification

### 3.1 Timing of CAS Storage

| Aspect | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **CAS Storage** | Immediate (on capture) | Delayed (on user selection) |
| **Storage Trigger** | `HandleCameraImageCaptured()` | User selection action |
| **Processing Location** | Camera capture handler | Photo selection handler |

### 3.2 Photo State Management

| Aspect | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Photo State** | Always processed | Unprocessed → Selected → Processed |
| **State Tracking** | `List<CapturedImage>` | Need state enum/flags |
| **Storage Reference** | Content hash immediately available | Hash generated on selection |

### 3.3 User Interaction Flow

| Aspect | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Preview** | Display processed images | Display unprocessed images |
| **Selection** | No selection (all photos processed) | Explicit photo selection required |
| **Processing Control** | Automatic | User-driven |

## 4. Architectural Impact Analysis

### 4.1 Component Changes Required

#### 4.1.1 DocumentCapture.razor
**High Impact Changes:**
- **HandleCameraImageCaptured()**: Remove immediate `ImageProcessingService.ProcessAsync()` call
- **New Method Required**: `ProcessSelectedImages()` for batch processing selected photos
- **State Management**: Track photo selection states
- **ProcessDocument()**: Modify to work with selected photos only

#### 4.1.2 CapturedImagesPreview.razor  
**Medium Impact Changes:**
- **Selection UI**: Add checkboxes or selection indicators
- **Visual States**: Different styling for selected vs unselected photos
- **Event Handling**: New selection change events
- **Batch Actions**: Select All/None functionality

#### 4.1.3 CapturedImage Model
**Low Impact Changes:**
- **Selection State**: Add `IsSelected` property
- **Processing State**: Add `IsProcessed` property or enum
- **Content Hash**: Make nullable (only set after processing)

### 4.2 Service Integration Changes

#### 4.2.1 IImageProcessingService
**No Interface Changes Required**: Existing `ProcessAsync()` method suitable

#### 4.2.2 Storage Service Integration
**Timing Change Required**: 
- Current: Called from `HandleCameraImageCaptured()`
- Proposed: Called from selection processing workflow

### 4.3 Data Model Updates Required

#### 4.3.1 Photo State Tracking
```csharp
public enum PhotoState
{
    Captured,    // Just captured, not processed
    Selected,    // User selected for processing
    Processing,  // Currently being processed
    Processed,   // Stored in CAS, ready for OCR
    Failed       // Processing failed
}
```

#### 4.3.2 CapturedImage Extensions
```csharp
public class CapturedImage
{
    // Existing properties...
    
    // NEW PROPERTIES NEEDED:
    public bool IsSelected { get; set; } = false;
    public PhotoState State { get; set; } = PhotoState.Captured;
    public string? ContentHash { get; set; } // Nullable until processed
}
```

## 5. Technical Complexity Assessment

### 5.1 Implementation Complexity: **Medium**

#### Low Complexity Areas:
- Data model additions (PhotoState enum, properties)
- UI selection indicators and checkboxes
- Event handler modifications

#### Medium Complexity Areas:
- Batch processing workflow for selected photos
- State management and UI synchronization
- Error handling for partial batch failures

#### High Complexity Areas:
- **None identified** - leverages existing components and services

### 5.2 Breaking Changes Analysis

#### Non-Breaking Changes:
- Adding properties to CapturedImage (backward compatible)
- New selection UI in CapturedImagesPreview
- Additional event callbacks

#### Potentially Breaking Changes:
- **None identified** - all changes are additive or internal workflow modifications

## 6. Component Method Mapping

### 6.1 Methods Requiring Changes

#### DocumentCapture.razor
| Method | Current Behavior | Required Changes |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| `HandleCameraImageCaptured()` | Immediate processing + CAS storage | Remove processing, keep local addition |
| `ProcessDocument()` | Process all captured images | Process only selected images |
| **NEW**: `ProcessSelectedImages()` | N/A | Batch process selected photos |
| **NEW**: `HandlePhotoSelection()` | N/A | Update selection state |

#### CapturedImagesPreview.razor
| Method | Current Behavior | Required Changes |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **NEW**: `HandleSelectionChange()` | N/A | Manage photo selection state |
| **NEW**: `SelectAll()/SelectNone()` | N/A | Batch selection operations |

### 6.2 State Management Modifications

#### Current State Variables
```csharp
private List<CapturedImage> capturedImages = new();
private ImageQualityResult? lastQualityResult;
```

#### Proposed State Variables  
```csharp
private List<CapturedImage> capturedImages = new();
private ImageQualityResult? lastQualityResult;
// NEW STATE VARIABLES:
private HashSet<string> selectedImageIds = new();
private bool isProcessingSelection = false;
private Dictionary<string, string> processedImageHashes = new(); // ImageId -> ContentHash
```

## 7. UI Changes Required

### 7.1 Selection Interface
- **Checkboxes**: Individual photo selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected state styling  
- **Batch Controls**: Select All/None buttons
- **Selection Counter**: "X of Y photos selected" indicator

### 7.2 Processing Controls
- **Process Selected Button**: Replace "Process Document" 
- **Selection Required**: Disable if no photos selected
- **Progress Indication**: Show processing status per photo

## 8. Data Flow Changes

### 8.1 Current Data Flow
```
CameraCapture → CapturedImage → HandleCameraImageCaptured() → 
ImageProcessingService.ProcessAsync() → CAS Storage → 
capturedImages.Add() → CapturedImagesPreview
```

### 8.2 Proposed Data Flow  
```
CameraCapture → CapturedImage → HandleCameraImageCaptured() →
capturedImages.Add() → CapturedImagesPreview →
User Selection → ProcessSelectedImages() →
ImageProcessingService.ProcessAsync() → CAS Storage
```
