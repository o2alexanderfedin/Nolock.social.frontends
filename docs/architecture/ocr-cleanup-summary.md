# OCR Architecture Document - Cleanup Summary

## Violations Found

The OCR architecture document (~3400 lines) is full of implementation code that violates core principles:

### SOLID Violations
- **Single Responsibility**: Document tries to be both architecture AND implementation
- **Interface Segregation**: Full class implementations instead of just interfaces

### KISS Violations  
- 70+ lines of CASStorage implementation (REMOVED)
- 50+ lines of DocumentProcessingService implementation
- Dozens of mapper class implementations
- Test class implementations in an architecture doc!

### DRY Violations
- Implementation code duplicated between doc and source files
- Maintenance nightmare when code changes

### YAGNI Violations
- Detailed implementation that changes frequently
- Private field declarations that don't belong in architecture

### TRIZ Violations
- "What if this implementation didn't exist in the doc?" - It shouldn't!
- Architecture should describe WHAT, not HOW

## What Should Be in Architecture Doc

### YES - Keep These:
- High-level component descriptions
- Interface definitions (minimal)
- Mermaid diagrams showing flow
- Technology choices and rationale
- Integration points
- Security considerations

### NO - Remove These:
- Class implementations
- Private fields
- Method bodies
- Implementation logic
- Test code
- Detailed algorithms

## Recommendation

The document needs aggressive cleanup:
1. Remove ALL class implementations
2. Replace with architectural descriptions
3. Use diagrams instead of code
4. Focus on WHAT not HOW
5. Target: ~1000 lines instead of 3400+
