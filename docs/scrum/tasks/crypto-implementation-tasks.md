## Critical Implementation Invariants

### Deterministic Key Derivation Guarantee
The following derivation logic is IMMUTABLE and must be preserved exactly:

```javascript
// THIS CODE IS CONTRACTUAL - DO NOT MODIFY
const deriveMasterKey = async (password, username) => {
  // Step 1: Normalize username to lowercase for salt
  const normalizedUsername = username.toLowerCase();
  
  // Step 2: Generate salt from username
  const salt = await sha256(normalizedUsername);
  
  // Step 3: Derive key with exact parameters
  return argon2id(password, salt, {
    memory: 65536,      // 64MB exactly
    iterations: 3,      // 3 passes exactly
    parallelism: 1,     // Single thread (WASM constraint)
    hashLength: 32      // 32 bytes output
  });
};
```

**Why These Parameters Are Immutable:**
- Changing ANY parameter produces different keys
- Existing users would lose access to their identities
- No migration path exists for deterministic systems
- These parameters are cryptographically sufficient for security

### Testing Invariants
Every build MUST verify these test vectors pass:
```
Username: "testuser"
Password: "testpassword123"
Expected Public Key: [MUST BE GENERATED AND FIXED IN TESTS]
```
