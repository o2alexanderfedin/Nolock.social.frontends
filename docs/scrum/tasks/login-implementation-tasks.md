## Task Management Guide for Kanban Process

### Working with Tasks
- **Task Size**: Each task is designed to be completed in 2-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Tasks are ordered by dependency - complete prerequisites first
- **Testing**: Each component has a corresponding test task that should be completed immediately after implementation
- **References**: Each task references the relevant section in `/docs/architecture/security/minimal-login-architecture.md`
- **Definition of Done**: Task is complete when code is implemented, tests pass, and integration is verified

### Task States in Kanban
1. **Backlog**: Task identified but not started
2. **In Progress**: Actively being worked on (limit to 1-2 tasks per developer)
3. **Review**: Code complete, awaiting review
4. **Testing**: Under test verification
5. **Done**: Fully complete and integrated

### Priority Levels
- **P0**: Critical path - blocks other work
