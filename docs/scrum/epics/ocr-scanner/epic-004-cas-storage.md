**Epic ID**: OCR-EPIC-004  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Path - Foundation)  
**Theme**: Immutable Storage Infrastructure  
**Business Owner**: Platform Architecture Team  
**Technical Lead**: Storage Systems Team  

## Business Value Statement

Establish a unified, immutable storage system using Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) that ensures data integrity, automatic deduplication, and simplified architecture by storing all documents, images, OCR results, and metadata using content hashes, eliminating the need for traditional databases while providing guaranteed data immutability and natural versioning.

## Business Objectives

1. **Data Integrity**: Guarantee documents cannot be tampered with after storage
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Automatic deduplication reduces storage costs by 30-40%
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Single storage system replaces multiple databases
4. **Natural Versioning**: Document updates create new versions without data loss
5. **Compliance Ready**: Immutable audit trail for regulatory requirements
