# IPFS Test Coverage Decision

## Date: 2025-09-13
## Decision: Browser-based integration tests NOT required

### Current Coverage (Sufficient)
- **42 unit tests** covering all C# logic
- **Behavior verification** via mocked JavaScript interop
- **Edge cases tested**: empty files, large files, seeking, disposal
- **Integration points verified**: correct JS method calls

### Rationale (Following Productive Laziness)
1. **YAGNI**: JavaScript layer is 50 lines of pass-through code
2. **KISS**: Don't test Helia library - it has its own tests
3. **DRY**: Avoid duplicating Helia's test coverage
4. **Resource constraints**: iOS Safari 200MB, Android Go 512MB limits

### What We're Testing vs Not Testing
✅ **Testing (Our Code)**:
- C# stream buffering logic
- Seek operations and position tracking
- Disposal and resource cleanup
- Error handling and edge cases

❌ **Not Testing (Library Code)**:
- Helia MFS operations (library's responsibility)
- IndexedDB persistence (browser API)
- JavaScript pass-through methods (no logic)

### Future Considerations
Browser tests would only be needed if:
- Complex JavaScript logic is added beyond simple forwarding
- Custom caching or optimization logic in JS layer
- Browser-specific workarounds are implemented

## Conclusion
Current test coverage is appropriate and follows SOLID/KISS/DRY/YAGNI principles.
Adding browser tests would violate Productive Laziness by testing library code we don't own.
